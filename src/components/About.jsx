                    <p>I'm looking for front-end or back-end developer roles and is
                        an immediate joiner. I've been working as a Software Engineer
                        at DCKAP Technologies right after my college.
                        Have been trained on HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React.js, Node.js, mongoDB
                        and mongoose. Have developed website frontend code using
                        the figma mockup designs and added functionalities.
                        Also have been assisting server side running of
                        a product developing for an e-commerce distributor in US.

                        Government Engineering College, Thrissur, Kerala in 2022.
                        After my college I joined DCKAP through placement.
                        Recently I have completed a Software Testing course and

                        acquire leadership roles.
